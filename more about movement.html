                <p> The organization that launched the Adopt Don’t Shop campaign is Los Angeles-based Last Chance for Animals (LCA), an international, nonprofit animal advocacy organization focused on investigating, exposing and ending animal exploitation since 1984. LCA founder Chris DeRose is a leader in the animal rights movement and works closely with countless individuals and groups dedicated to humane treatment of animals.

                    <p>The Adopt Don’t Shop Movement is a movement that has been around for quite a while but in the recent years it has become more known, this movement advises people who want to invest in a pet such as a dog or cat to go through a humane society or rescue center instead of going through a breeder or puppy mill to get a dog. .</p>

                  <p>The coronavirus has brought good news and bad news for cats and dogs.Some people abandoned their pets having read fake news that dogs and cats could transfer COVID-19. Others were losing their jobs or felt they could not cope for various reasons.Vets have since assured the public that their pets are not vectors for the pandemic. Over the past two days when Covid-19 spread in Israel, no new furry visitors have appeared at the Tel Aviv SPCA’s doors. At the same time, there is good news. Adoptions have rocketed, almost balancing the abandonments out, at the Tel Aviv SPCA. According to Vitner(Gadi Vitner, the spokesman of Tel Aviv Shelter), the same time period had seen around 40 animals finding a home.Vitner worries that when the crisis is over, and families return to work and school, many of the animals now being adopted will be returned to the shelter.Every time there’s a major change in routine, it’s the pets that pay. But pets don’t need to pay for it. We can deal with all changes in our life better then just abandon someone who’s really depends on us. Taking a pet-is big responsibility and we can’t play with it!

                    <li>Because adoption helps more than just one animal
                      <p>Overburdened shelters take in millions of stray, abused and lost animals every year, and by adopting an animal, you’re making room for others. Not only are you giving more animals a second chance, but the cost of your adoption goes directly towards helping those shelters better care for the animals they take in!</p>

                    <li>You help break the cycle of pet overpopulation
                      <p>There are not enough homes for all the animals that are born every year. Adopting from a shelter helps weaken the pet overpopulation cycle. Each year 8 to 12 million dogs, cats, puppies and kittens are euthanized because there are simply not enough homes for them.</p>
